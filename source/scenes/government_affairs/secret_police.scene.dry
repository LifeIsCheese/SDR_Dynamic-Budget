The Interior Ministry controls internal security throughout the German Republic. We can use this power to further the social democratic cause.

High levels of loyalty should be a given, but not required to go through with *any* of these.

With the Reichsbank being controlled by a known reactionary who collaborated with the Nazis. The only way for us to push out our fiscal reforms is by his Death.

Operation Reversed Scale has commenced.

With the unpopularity of Bruning’s austerity measures, and the negotiations our radical wing to unite our party under his death, the plan has received cautious approval.

Due to the nature of our operation, we need to have a strong network of <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">**spies**</span> to keep the police in check. If strong enough it will stop the decay of loyalty when planning.

The order is given, and with the unpopularity of Bruning’s austerity measures, no one should bat an eye towards his sudden death. At least… if no one leaks the plans prematurely.

Operation Ivory Tower has commenced.

on-arrival: resources -=2; spy_network +=3

By funding our spy network, we can rely on them to serve as a watchdog, during our operations.

@partners
title: To further increase the progression of our plot, we must choose who to work with...

Who should we work with on this operation?

- @interior: The Interior security forces only.
- @prussia: The Prrussian police should join as well.
- @reichsbanner: Due to it's large size, the reichsbanner can prove useful during direct encounters.
- @spies: Let's keep it small.

@interior
subtitle: -1 Budget. The progression rate of our operation will be slow but this is the most safest option, provided the internal security are loyal. [? if interior_police_loyalty < 0.55: The internal security are disloyal. But maybe they'll recognize the danger Hjalmar Schacht poses for the government? ?]
choose-if: budget > 0
on-arrival: plot_strength = 5; assassination_partners = "Police"; resources +=1; {! <script>new_hire();</script> !}

We brief the internal police on our plan, time will tell if it succedes. 

@prussia
subtitle: -1 Budget. Though the extra manpower is nice, if any of the 2 are disloyal it will lead to disaster. [? if interior_police_loyalty < 0.55: The internal security are disloyal. But maybe they'll recognize the danger Hjalmar Schacht poses for the government? ?] [? if prussian_police_loyalty < 0.5: The Prussian police still seem divided on this cause, but we do need the manpower. ?]
choose-if: budget > 0
on-arrival: plot_strength = 10; assassination_partners = "Prussian"; resources +=1; {! <script>new_hire();</script> !}

By also working with the prussian police, as well as the internal police, we can get things done much faster... 

@reichsbanner
subtitle: -1 Budget. By getting the reichsbanner involved in this operation, we can brute force our way into killing [+ plot_target +]... [? if interior_police_loyalty < 0.55: The internal security are disloyal. But maybe they'll recognize the danger Hjalmar Schacht poses for the government? ?] [? if rb_exit != 1: The moderates would never allow this. ?]
choose-if: rb_exit == 1 and budget > 0
on-arrival: plot_strength = 20; assassination_partners = "Reichsbanner"; resources +=1; {! <script>new_hire();</script> !}

With the liberals ousted from the Reichsbanner, we can finally leverage it's massive numbers.

@spies
subtitle: [? if spy_network < 10 : -2 resources Least riskiest iption, but slowest?] [? if spy_network >= 9 : If we pour in too much funds into our spies, it may attract unwanted attention. 0 resources. ?]
choose-if: resources > 1
on-arrival: spy_network +=3 if spy_network < 10; plot_strength = spy_network; resources -=2 if spy_network < 10; assassination_partners = "Spies"; resources +=1; {! <script>new_hire();</script> !}

Use our own network of <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">**spies**</span> to carry this out instead. This is the slowest option, but perhaps with more funding we can change that.
