= Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy involves issues of taxation and budget.

# TODO: add indications of current taxation status

Making the tax system more progressive is popular among our base, but it upsets our bourgeois coalition partners, as well as our minimal number of bourgeois voters.

Raising taxes on the rich is popular among our base, but it alienates the bourgeoisie. Increasing taxes also decreases economic demand, which may lead to more unemployment.

Cutting taxes benefits most the rich and middle-class, who pay more taxes than the working class. Our coalition partners are happy at our orthodox economic course.

Cutting taxes benefits most the rich and middle-class, who pay more taxes than the working class. Our coalition partners are upset at our deficit spending, warning that it will lead to a repeat of the hyperinflation in the early history of our republic. The Center Marxists join in these warnings.

Raising taxes hurts our support among all those who pay taxes. [? if in_grand_coalition or in_weimar_coalition : However, our coalition partners are more supportive of the idea of "shared sacrifice" than simply taxing the rich. ?] Increasing taxes also decreases economic demand, which may lead to more unemployment.

on-arrival: workers_spd -= 6; new_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 4*(1-dissent); dvp_relation += 5; z_relation += 4; coalition_dissent -= 1 if in_grand_coalition and coalition_dissent > 0; kpd_coalition_dissent += 1; upper_tax_rates -= 1; lower_tax_rates += 1; workers_spd -= 5 if lower_tax_rates >= 2; capital_strike_progress -= 1 if upper_tax_rates < 0; socialism -= 3

Our regressive taxation policy benefits the rich while hurting the poor and working-class. Our bourgeois coalition partners approve of this orthodox economic course.

@tariffs
title: Change tariffs instead.

Tariffs, or taxes on international imports, are another way to finance our government.

Historically, socialists have been in favor of free trade and a low-tariff regime. Workers in export-oriented industries benefit from free trade, and they also benefit from lower prices for imported necessities. Do the present economic circumstances change these calculations?

Current tariff level: [+ tariffs : taxation +]

- @raise_tariffs
- @lower_tariffs
- @fiscal_menu: Change domestic taxes instead of tariffs.
- @root: Do not change tariffs or taxes.

@raise_tariffs
title: Raise tariffs on imports.
subtitle: +2 budget. Other countries will retaliate by increasing tariffs of their own. [? if tariffs > 5 : Further increases in tariffs will not raise revenue, as we have already nearly reached econonmic autarky. ?]
choose-if: tariffs <= 5
on-arrival: tariffs += 1; inflation += 1 if inflation > 0; inflation += 0.5 if inflation <= 0; unemployed += 1.5; budget += 2; workers_spd -= 5; unemployed_spd -= 5; rural_spd += 4*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 3*(1-dissent); ddp_relation -= 5; dvp_relation -= 2; west_relation -= 1; east_relation -= 1; reparations_negotiation -= 2; eu_progress -= 1 if eu_progress > 0; peoples_party_support += 1; economic_growth -= 0.4; capital_strike_progress += 1 if tariffs >= 3; socialism -= 2

Increasing tariffs leads to higher prices for basic goods, increasing inflation and hurting consumption among the working class. Retaliatory tariffs reduce the competitiveness of German exports, raising unemployment among workers. They also lead to an atmosphere of international suspicion, reducing our ability to negotiate with other countries.

On the other hand, agricultural producers and some small businesses benefit from higher tariffs, as farmers can now command higher prices for grain, and formerly uncompetitive businesses are now able to function.

@lower_tariffs
title: Lower tariffs on imports.
choose-if: budget >= 2 and tariffs > -5
subtitle: -2 budget. [? if tariffs <= -5 : There are no tariffs left to cut. ?]
on-arrival: tariffs -= 1; budget -= 2; inflation -= 0.5; workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 4*(1-dissent); rural_spd -= 5; old_middle_spd -= 3; west_relation += 1; east_relation += 1; eu_progress += 1 if eu_progress > 0; economic_growth += 0.4; socialism += 2

Lowering tariffs helps workers and the urban poor by reducing prices for basic necessities. In addition, other countries are pleased by lower tariffs, and are more willing to negotiate on many issues.

Farmers are hurt by this policy, as cheap imported grain leads to ruin for some small producers. In general, cheap imports are detrimental for small-scale industries aimed at the domestic market.

Originally set up as a way to reduce burden on our reparations, we can reform this to work more like actual bonds. A sort of, Reichsbond.

By issuing bonds we can bolster economic growth, or other things.
