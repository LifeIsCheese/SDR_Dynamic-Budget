Increasing interest rates decreases inflation, especially if inflation is high. [? if economic_growth < 3: Hans luther reluctanctly agrees, but thinks less of us because he thinks economic growth is too low?]

Decreasing interest rates stimulates economic growth, but increases inflation. [? if inflation >= 5: Hans luther reluctanctly agrees, but thinks less of us because he thinks inflation is too high?]

By transferring our funds in Hans Luther's wallet, he may think more highly of us.
