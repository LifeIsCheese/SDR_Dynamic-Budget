Due to the dire state of the Reichsbanner during this trying time, the democratic parties beg for it's militarization.

- @repbulican_unity: Further broaden the the Reichsbanner membership.
- @increase_militancy: We can heavily increase the Reichsbanner's militancy.
- @increase_militancy_r: We can heavily increase the Reichsbanner's militancy.
- @no: Why would we do this?

There are outcries from both within our party and out. But our coffers are strained and this is our only option. [? if budget > 1 or resources > 1 : Despite our surplus??? ?]
