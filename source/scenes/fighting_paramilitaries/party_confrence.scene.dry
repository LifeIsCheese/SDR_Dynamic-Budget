= Party Conference

Despite [+ z_party_leader +]'s and Braun's cooperation in rushing the extremists, we haven't been able to get in government. This poses a problem for us, the left of the party calls for joining in with the communists, letting the Center and democratic parties fend for themselves. While the reformists still want to help them, for the sake of stability and democracy.

- @help: For the sake of stability, we will help the bourgeois.
- @left: They have bterayed us, it is better if we work with the KPD instead.

The left is enraged at our decision, with some leaders even defecting to the KPD.
