= Bonds

We can issue bonds to fund our forces. This will be controversian, within our party and out, but perhaps it is needed.

- @issue_bond_1: Issue a small number of bonds.
- @issue_bond_2: Issue a sizeable number of bonds.
- @issue_bond_3: Issue a large number of bonds
- @root: We are fine as it is.

We have to pay this back at 30% interest rate per year, for 4 years. if we go into deficit spending in this, we *can* have the option to default, this is not recommended.
