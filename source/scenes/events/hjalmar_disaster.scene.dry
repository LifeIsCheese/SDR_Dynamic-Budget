= [+ year +], A great Scandal

**An excerpt from a small town newspaper.**

It has been made apparent, the crimes of the so called ‘Social Democratic Party’ has been revealed in its entirety. A failed attempt to assassinate the nation’s saviour from the disaster that was hyperinflation, all to further the radical SPD’s agenda. 

This only serves as a testament of the demonic forces that the SPD harbors, only now removing its sheep’s clothing. For too long have we tolerated the SPD, we urge *you* dear reader to go to the polls and save Germany.

- @done: There is nothing we can do.
- @spies: We can use our large network of spies to mitigate the effects
