“The current Chancellor of the Republic, dubbed The Hunger Chancellor by the working class, was found on the stairs of his residence, slumped over dead with a pool of blood surrounding him. His cause of death, as of now, remains unknown, and any trace of evidence has seemingly been taken away from the scene in a deliberate attempt to cover their tracks. Members of the Reichstag, most notably Otto Braun and [+ z_party_leader +] have recently called for an emergency session to discuss the course of action, as such an event could spark an upsurge of extremist activity.”

The Reichstag has spoken, we will crush the paramilitaries as much as possible.

[? if spd_in_government != 1 : We will hold elections in 3 months, as we are not in government. ?]
