= Martial Law

Seeing the continuing collapse of order in Germany, and convinced that they would be able to quell any resistance, President [+ president +] and Chancellor Seldte have come together to declare a state of martial law in Germany. Though this is unconstitutional, the courts have little sway over the enthusiastic army.

subtitle: The beginning of the end.

The destruction of German democracy has begun, not at the hands of the Nazis but at the hands of the reactionaries who wish to see a return to the days of the German Empire. If we do not fight back now, then we may never get another chance, and all we as a party have stood for will be gone in an instant.

- @fight_harzburg: Mobilize our forces and declare a general strike!
- @reactionary_victory: We have lost.

Party offices are raided by army and police forces. Our leaders are rounded up and arrested. Any and all of our reforms are undone, and a police state under the army's control is cemented. The Nazis have failed to take power, but we cannot take much comfort in the fact when a dictatorial fascist government rules all the same. Perhaps in the far future, we may have our moment in the sun once more. We will have a duty to do better then than we have now.

- @game_over: Game over.
