= Suspicion from the right

Our infiltrators have informed us of the right suspicion in our ongoing plot against Hjalmar Schacht. 
Of course they haven't found out anything related to it, but it does raise a serious security issue. 

We fear that the right has sent <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">**spies**</span> within our ranks to figure out our plot.

Current interior police loyalty: [+ interior_police_loyalty : loyalty +]. [? if interior_police_loyalty < 0.55: The police show frighteningly low levels of loyalty. ?]

[? if plot_strength == 10: Current prussian police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +]. [? if prussian_police_loyalty < 0.5: The Prussian police seem untrustworthy. ?] ?]

- @purge: Start the purges.
- @bribe: Perhaps we can bribe them.
- @investigate: All precautions must be taken, better safe than sorry.
- @root: We are fine as it is.

@purge
subtitle: We can purge the most suspicous of our police, this well set us back by a few months.
on-arrival: hjalmar_plot = 10; interior_police_loyalty *= 1.5; prussian_police_loyalty *= 1.5

Despite our crude efforts, the results seem promising.

@bribe
subtitle: -1 budget. By doing a general pay raise, we can ensure that any infiltrators have an incentive to stay shut.
choose-if: budget > 0
on-arrival: interior_police_loyalty *= 1.5; prussian_police_loyalty *= 1.5; budget -=1

Despite reformist cries of already spending too much on this operation, this seems to be the most effective course of action.

@investigate
subtitle: We can perform an investigation to find these spies, but the speed of our planning will be significantly slower.
choose-if: budget > 0
on-arrival: plot_strength *= 0.5; interior_police_loyalty *= 1.5; prussian_police_loyalty *= 1.5

The investigatations are approved, with many key members being outed as Nazi spies.
