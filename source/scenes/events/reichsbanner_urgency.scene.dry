something about oh wow yay

- @repbulican_unity: Use this further broaden the the Reichsbanner membership.
- @increase_militancy: We *reluctantly* increase the Reichsbanner's militancy.
- @no: Why would we do this?

@repbulican_unity
subtitle: Heavily increase membership. -1 resource
choose-if: resources > 0
on-arrival: rb_strength += 500; weimar_dissent -= 2; coalition_dissent -= 2; resources -=1; z_relation += 10; ddp_relation +=10; dvp_relation +=5

We start using our media empure, in combination with the Center and the Democratic Party to heavily advertise the Reichsbanner.


@increase_militancy
subtitle: -1 budget
choose-if: budget > 0
on-arrival: rb_militancy +=0.15; weimar_dissent -= 2; budget -=1; rb_strength += 200; coalition_dissent -= 1

Heading to the other parties' requests, we increase the Reichsbanner's military training.


@no
subtitle: Perhaps we don't have the funds.
on-arrival: z_relation -= 10; ddp_relation -=10; dvp_relation -=5; center_dissent += 10; labor_dissent +=10; left_dissent += 15; reformist_dissent +=10

There are outcries from both within our party and out. But our coffers are strained and this is our only option. [? if budget > 0 or resources > 0 : Despite our surplus. ?]
