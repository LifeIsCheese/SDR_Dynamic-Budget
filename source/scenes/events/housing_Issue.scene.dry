= Housing Isssue

High interest rates combined with a slow economy leads to people of all social classes struggle to either find houses / apartments, or struggle to pay them off.

The people and the press are clamoring for action to fix this housing crisis.

- @interest: lower interest rates.
- @rent: Introduce a rent cap
- @invest: Invest in nationwide housing projects
-@invest_wtb: Further invest in nationwide housing projects
- @nothing: Realistically, there is nothing we can do.

@interest
title: Lower interest rates.
subtitle: (Heavily increases inflation) [? if interest_rates <= -2 : Interest rates are too low. ?]
choose-if: interest_rates > -2
on-arrival: interest_rates -=3; left_dissent += 2; labor_dissent += 2; center_dissent += 2; inflation +=4; housing_crisis = 1

This is merely a bandage fix, with the majority of our party are clamoring for further reform.

@rent
title: Introduce a federal rent cap.
subtitle: -1 Budget. Our coalition partners will <span style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);">**not**</span> like this. [? if budget <= 0 : Insufficient budget. ?]
choose-if: budget >=1
on-arrival: budget -=1; new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); coalition_dissent += 2; dvp_relation -= 5*(1-dissent); z_relation -= 5*(1-dissent); capital_strike_progress += 1; economic_growth -= 0.2

This is popular in all classes, especially the working class. But the bourgeoisie will be displeased due to our intrusion in the economy.

subtitle: -2 Budget. [? if budget <= 2 : Insufficient budget. ?]

on-arrival: budget -=2; new_middle_spd += 8*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 4*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 8*(1-dissent); economic_growth += 0.9

Millions of Reichsmarks pour into the construction of public and co-operative housing.

There is nothing we can do.
