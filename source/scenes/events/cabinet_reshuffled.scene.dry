[+ chancellor +] has announced his intentions to [+ president +] to reshuffle the cabinet, sacking and replacing all current SPD ministers and replacing them with bourgeois ones. [? if bourgeois_coalition < 50 and right_coalition < 50 : Luckily, they lack a majority without us, so we can bring them down with a simple motion of no confidence. ?]

- @try_assuage: Try to assuage our partners.
- @right_coalition: The DNVP replaces us in government.

How do we assuage our partners?

- @give_up_prussia: Give up on leadership of Prussia.
