**Dirty deeds have dirty consequences,**

*N0 in the party knows who did it, but a rogue informant has leaked the documents to Operation Ivory Tower to Chancellor Bruning, and a party declaration by the Center has caused immense distrust between the SPD and the people. Workers and unions are disgusted by our actions, congregating to the KPD in an act of defiance against our conspiracies to unite the democratic parties under a stronger coalition, some even bleeding to the NSDAP and completely falling out of left-wing politics due to the black stain of corruption left by our various plots. Rejuvenation of the SPD’s reputation has become an impossible task, and the very republic that we have built through betrayal and bargaining is collapsing under its own weight.*

**Bruning has VONC’d our government!*^
**And we choke under the noose of our own making.**
