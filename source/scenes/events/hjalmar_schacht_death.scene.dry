The Reichsbank’s Dragon is Felled
Operation Reversed Scale has been proved successful!

Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, and a key member of the industrialist organization, the Circle of Friends of the Economy, has been found dead at his bedside. Though further autopsies have been scheduled, various bourgeois parties, including the DNVP and NSDAP, have blown the whistle against the KDP, immediately using them as a scapegoat for Hjalmar’s death. Replacing him is Hans Luther of the DVP, whom, while still somewhat resistant to the SPD’s presence in government, is far less connected with the NSDAP compared to his counterpart, and committed to the maintaining of the current political establishment. Adolf Hitler has lost a thread connecting him to the far-right and especially President Hindenburg, with the NSDAP’s efforts to manipulate the far-right parties being impeded, at least for now.
