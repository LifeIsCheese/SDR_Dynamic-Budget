= Mod Info

This mod adds a variety of changes to the base game, mostly in the form of flavor and minor improvements.

text above is old news, there are 2 paths you can take in this game, Social fasicist maxxing, or revisionist paradise.

- @dynamic_budget: Budget + Economy
- @interest_rates: Interest + Housing
- @QOL: Stuff

@dynamic_budget

= Budget Changes

Budget is now based on economic growth, 3% > is 1 budget, 6% > is 2 budget, 10% triggers an economic miracle. (Lasts after 1936) (Inflation has to be lower than economic growth)

- @flavors: Back

@interest_rates

= Fiscal Changes + Inflation and economic growth

Base inflation rate is determined by interest rates, a basic housing issue event will happen if interest rates are too high and economic growth is stagnant (will polish this)

@QOL

Investigating now actually gives information on what the right is up to.
